# Lab 5 Resources

To run either of the simple server scripts, first make the files executable:

		chmod +x simpleServer.py
		chmod +x index.html
		chmod +x cgi-bin/splash.py

Then you can launch the server by executing:

		./simpleServer.py

To test it from a browser you first need to know your server's ID and/or WWW port number. You can get that information from the [Virtual Server Manager](https://www.doc.gold.ac.uk/dept/VirtualServer).

From inside the college network it will be in the form: http://myserver.doc.gold.ac.uk:58106/

Or outside: http://www.doc.gold.ac.uk/usr/106/

Replace the \`106' in the above URL's with the ID of your own virtual server!
